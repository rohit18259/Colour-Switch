# Colour-Switch
This is a remake of the android game Colour-Switch, built in java for desktop. It is made using JavaFX.
This is a Game made by a group of 2 people, me and my partner Jasdeep Singh (https://github.com/Jasdeep71)
This game is made using java's object oriented principles.
Controls :- spacebar to jump, p to pause, mouse clicks to navigate through pages(save,load,etc.)
The player has to jump the ball upwards and pass through the obstacles (you can pass through the portion of the obstacle which has the same colour as the ball) and collect as many
points (stars).
You have options to reload, pause, resume, continue, save game, load game, etc.
